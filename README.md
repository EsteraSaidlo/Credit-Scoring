# Credit-Scoring

Before granting a loan, the bank verifies the credibility of the entity applying for the loan. Credit scoring is a method which verifies this credibility. The credit rating consists in determining the creditworthiness of the customers on the basis of comparing his profile with the profile of customers who have already received credits. The greater the similarity of the applicant's profile to the person who received the credit, the greater the chance to receive it. This project is dedicated to building a scoring model that will predict whether or not the applicant will receive a loan.

The methods used to build the model:
- Logistic Regression,
- Bagging,
- Boosting,
- Random Forest,
- Naive Bayes.

Methods of dealing with outliers used in the project:
- deletion,
- replacing NA and forecasting them using the k-neighbors method.

Methods of dealing with missing values used in the project:
- deletion,
- k-nearest neighbors forecasting.
